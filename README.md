# Earth Curvature Calculator

## Description

The Earth Curvature Calculator is a simple web-based application that allows users to calculate their horizon distance and determine the minimum height required for a remote object to be visible from a specified distance, given the observer's height above sea level. The application takes into account the curvature of the Earth in its calculations.

This application can be useful in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to navigation, geodesy, and geophysics.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface with simple input fields.
- Real-time calculation upon form submission.
- Visual representation of the geometry involved in the calculation through an SVG diagram.

## How to Use

To use the Earth Curvature Calculator, simply enter your height above sea level and the distance from the observer to the object in the appropriate fields, then click "Calculate". The results will be displayed immediately below the input fields.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for webpage structure.
- CSS for page styling and layout.
- JavaScript for form handling and calculations.
- SVG for the diagram display.

## Future Work

We aim to continually improve and expand the functionality of this application. Future updates may include the ability to dynamically update the diagram based on user inputs and other enhancements.
